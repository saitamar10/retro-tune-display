## Features

- **Vinyl Record Simulation**: Watch YouTube videos play as if they were on a vinyl record with realistic spinning animation
- **Playlist Management**: Create and manage your own playlist of YouTube videos
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find songs in your playlist
- **Favorites System**: Mark your favorite tracks for quick access
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

## How It Works

Simply paste a YouTube video URL into the input field, and the app will:

1. Extract the video ID
2. Fetch the video metadata (title, artist)
3. Add it to your playlist
4. Display it as a vinyl record when played

The audio comes directly from YouTube while the visual experience mimics the nostalgic feel of vinyl records.
